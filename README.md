## Current Focus

- Integrated photonics: silicon photonics, waveguide engineering, and mode-division multiplexing systems.
- Nonlinear quantum photonics: SPDC-oriented architectures, quasi-BIC concepts, and quantum-compatible device design.
- Physics-informed design: PINN-assisted inverse design and multiphysics optimization for photonic components.

## Featured Repositories

- NanoPhotoNet-MPM: Photonics modeling and inverse-design workflows (repository not public yet).
